## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to allow users to track invasive species of plant in several Duluth parks.
Users will be able to where others have spotted invasive plants, what species they are, and when the species in that area were last cleared.

## Current Functionality
Currently, this app is able to displays grids over parks, these grids may be edited via clicking and adding species to the grid. The current login system is our own, it will be swapped out for gmail authentication before the app's completion. The tracked tiles show as a different color.

## Features To Implement
* Markers will be used to track specific instances of plants found.
* Markers will be filter-able based on plant.
* Markers will be viewable when a grid is selected, or when a user is standing in the appropriate grid area.
* Users will be able to comment about their findings and what they've observed regarding an entire tile area.
* When users remove a marker from the map, they will be prompted for a reason for removal. This will create a cleaning log that may be reviewed.
